## Features

Extinguish turns off the screen using Android’s hidden function. It truly turns off the device’s
screen rather than displaying a black overlay, making it suitable for various types of screens,
including LCD and OLED.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The behavior of systems modified by device manufacturers
> may differ from expected, so Extinguish may not work
> properly on some systems.

Extinguish supports using the following methods to control the screen state:

- Floating button
- Volume key event
- Touch screen
- Notification
- Quick settings tile
- ADB command

> Floating button is including a timer popup. You can set
> when the screen turns on after it turns off.
